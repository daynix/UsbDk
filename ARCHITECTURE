    USB Development Kit (UsbDk) Design and Architecture
    =============================================================

USB Development Kit is a set of software modules meant to provide
user mode applications with direct and exclusive access to USB devices
by detaching those from Windows PNP manager and device drivers and
providing user mode with API for USB-specific operations on the device.

Original intention of the kit is USB device redirection support for
spice remote desktop application however it may be used for any other
purpose directly or via libusb (there is a libusb backend for UsbDk).

USB Development Kit software consists of following modules:

  1. UsbDk.sys - USB bus filter driver for acquisition of exclusive
      access to USB devices.
  2. UsbDkHelper.dll - Helper DLL to install, uninstall and configure
     the driver and forward USB requests to USB devices.
  3. UsbDkController.exe - Simple command line application for system
     API usage demonstration and verification.

Using USB Development Kit for USB devices redirection (exclusive access aquisition)

USB Development Kit software is used by virt-viewer for USB devices
discovery and access as required for redirection purposes.

Kernel mode component (UsbDk.sys) design and functionality
----------------------------------------------------------

UsbDk.sys is both USB filter driver and generic USB device driver.
On installation it is being registered as USB filter driver and
system invokes it for each new USB device being discovered including
USB hubs. On invocation UsbDk.sys checks type of underlying device
and creates filter instances for USB hubs only.

Being a filter of USB hub UsbDk.sys receives all requests from upper
part of USB stack including enumeration requests that originated by
PNP manager (IRP_MJ_PNP/IRP_MN_QUERY_DEVICE_RELATIONS).

Upon enumeration request completion by USB hub driver UsbDk.sys scans
array of child devices returned and in case there are devices to be
redirected (according to current configuration) it attaches as filter
to those devices as well.

As a result all PNP manager requests pass via UsbDk.sys callbacks and the
latter patches device ID properties as needed to make PNP manager recognize
the device as a generic USB device.

Besides that UsbDk.sys marks underlying device object as raw PDO so the system
assigns the driver who created it (UsbDk.sys) to be the device driver as well.

At this stage any request to this vendor specific device will be forwarded
to UsbDk.sys which in turn will patch and pass requests to/from original device
created by USB hub as needed.

There is also a separate API provided by UsbDkHelper.dll intended to detach
USB device from USB stack without acquiring actual access to the device (hider API).

This API may be useful for security applications that need to deny access
to USB devices according to security policy or to prevent Windows from showing
"New Hardware" pop-ups for devices solely managed by UsbDk. When UsbDk.sys
discovers device to be hidden during enumeration phase
(IRP_MJ_PNP/IRP_MN_QUERY_DEVICE_RELATIONS) it wipes corresponding PDO from
device array returned by underlying USB bus driver, this effectively hides
given device from PNP manager and OS driver stack.
