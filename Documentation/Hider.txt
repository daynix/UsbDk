Short description of Device Hider feature:
The interface is described in UsbDkHelperHider.h
It includes basic and extended interfaces:

1. Basic interface:
UsbDk_AddPersistentHideRule
UsbDk_DeletePersistentHideRule
UsbDk_AddHideRule
UsbDk_ClearHideRules

Rule structure includes:
Class
BCD
Vendor ID
Product ID
Hide specifier (0 or 1), 0 is terminal, 1 continues for next rule

Class describes device class as specified in device descriptor.
Checkers for these rules do not check classes of interfaces in multifunction devices,
i.e.
class match = (device class == rule class) or (rule class == -1)

2. Extended interface
UsbDk_AddExtendedHideRule
UsbDk_AddExtendedPersistentHideRule
UsbDk_DeleteExtendedPersistentHideRule

These API calls receive the same rule structure as basic API and
an additional parameter 'Rule Type', which can be
0 (USBDK_HIDER_RULE_DEFAULT) or 1 (USBDK_HIDER_RULE_DETERMINATIVE_TYPES)

Using extended API with USBDK_HIDER_RULE_DEFAULT produces exactly the
same result as using basic API.

Using USBDK_HIDER_RULE_DETERMINATIVE_TYPES forces different processing
of hiding rules:

Rule structure includes the same fields:
Class (bitmask of device types to match)
BCD
Vendor ID
Product ID
Hide specifier (0 or 1), 0 is terminal, 1 continues for next rule

Device type for each specific device is determined from device class as specified
in device descriptor and 'class' field in all the interface descriptors of all
device's configurations.

Supported classes are:
USB_DEVICE_CLASS_AUDIO (0x1) -> USB_DEVICE_CLASS_AUDIO

USB_DEVICE_CLASS_COMMUNICATIONS(0x2)
USB_DEVICE_CLASS_CDC_DATA(0xA)
USB_DEVICE_CLASS_WIRELESS_CONTROLLER(0xE0) -> USB_DEVICE_CLASS_COMMUNICATIONS

USB_DEVICE_CLASS_PRINTER(0x7) -> USB_DEVICE_CLASS_PRINTER
USB_DEVICE_CLASS_STORAGE(0x8) -> USB_DEVICE_CLASS_STORAGE
USB_DEVICE_CLASS_VIDEO(0xE) -> USB_DEVICE_CLASS_VIDEO
USB_DEVICE_CLASS_AUDIO_VIDEO(0x10) -> USB_DEVICE_CLASS_AUDIO, USB_DEVICE_CLASS_VIDEO
USB_DEVICE_CLASS_HUMAN_INTERFACE(0x3) -> USB_DEVICE_CLASS_HUMAN_INTERFACE

All other classes -> OTHER (31)

Following classes are determinative (if the device belongs to one
of determinative types, all device types except of
determinative one are removed from device type bitmask):
The order of determinative types is:
USB_DEVICE_CLASS_PRINTER
USB_DEVICE_CLASS_COMMUNICATIONS
USB_DEVICE_CLASS_AUDIO
USB_DEVICE_CLASS_VIDEO

Checkers for these rules check resulting set of device type and
device types of interfaces in multifunction devices, i.e.
Class match = (device type bitmask) & (rule class bitmask) != 0

Example of usage:
Rule.BCD = Rule.VID = Rule.PID = -1;
Rule.Hide = 1;
Rule.Class = (1 << USB_DEVICE_CLASS_STORAGE) | (1 << USB_DEVICE_CLASS_PRINTER);
UsbDk_AddExtendedPersistentHideRule(&Rule, USBDK_HIDER_RULE_DETERMINATIVE_TYPES);
This call will Hide all the device that determined as being mass storage
devices or printer devices.
